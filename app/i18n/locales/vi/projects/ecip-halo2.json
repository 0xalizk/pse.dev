  "description": "Liam Eagen has developed a ZK proof for Elliptic Curve Inner Products (ECIPs) to overcome a significant bottle neck in recursive proof composition over elliptic curve cycles. The process of integrating Nova into the EVM requires an efficient method or \"argument\" for handling large elliptic Multi-Scalar Multiplications (MSMs). The final step in this integration process involves wrapping this argument Halo 2."
