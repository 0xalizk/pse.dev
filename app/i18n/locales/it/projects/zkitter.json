  "description": "Zkitter is a decentralized social network that emphasizes privacy by default. It allows users to share thoughts and communicate in various modes: as known identities, as a member of a group, or entirely anonymously. Built with Semaphore and RLN, Zkitter offers familiar social media features such as posting, chatting, following, and liking, but with a strong focus on user privacy and anonymity. It serves as an experiment to explore new ways of engaging in conversations without the fear of damaging oneâ€™s personal reputation and is an example of a user-facing application using zero-knowledge primitives such as Semaphore, CryptKeeper, ZK-Chat, and Interep. Users can sign up using an Ethereum address or ENS name, or create an anonymous account, with options for anonymous chat and posting.",
