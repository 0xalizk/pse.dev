  "description": "zkEVM Community Edition is a project aimed at validating Ethereum blocks using zero-knowledge proofs. It is designed to be fully compatible with Ethereum's EVM and serves two primary goals. First, it enables the creation of a layer 2 network (zkRollup) compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem, which uses zero-knowledge proofs to validate blocks, thus enhancing scalability. Second, it allows the generation of zero-knowledge proofs for blocks from the existing layer 1 Ethereum network, enabling light clients to quickly synchronize many blocks with low resource consumption while ensuring block correctness without needing trust in external parties.",
  "tldr": "A zero-knowledge proof mechanism for Ethereum block verification."
