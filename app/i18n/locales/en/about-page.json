  "title": "About our team",
  "description": "PSE is a multi-disciplinary research and development lab supported by the Ethereum Foundation. We create open source infrastructure, tools and educational resources for building cryptography into real world applications.",
  "our-principles-title": "Our principles",
  "principle-1-title": "01. Cryptography for people",
  "principle-1-description": [],
  "principle-2-title": "02. Privacy by default",
  "principle-2-description": [
    "We believe that privacy is a fundamental right. We want to be part of building an internet that divests from invasive data practices, and instead gives people real choices about who has access to their personal information. Permission should be purpose specific, revocable, informed and uncoerced.",
    "We make tools that help people to securely authenticate themselves, make confidential transactions on the blockchain, and respect and preserve user privacy."
  ],
  "principle-3-title": "03. Scaling for communities",
  "principle-3-description": [
    "Zero knowledge proofs can verify computations quickly and cheaply, helping decentralized systems like Ethereum become more efficient. We research, design and share scaling solutions that anyone can use to contribute to a stronger and more practical digital public infrastructure.",
    "We also grow our community by supporting the next generation of builders. We host immersive summer programs for students and regular live lectures that anyone in the world can join and learn from."
  ],
  "principle-4-title": "04. Open source public goods",
  "principle-4-description": [
    "We are cultivating a diverse and multidisciplinary team to explore the emerging zero knowledge ecosystem. PSE is made up of programmers, engineers, and mathematicians working alongside creatives and community organizers to collaboratively discover the potential of programmable cryptography.",
    "We experiment in the open and welcome contributions, integrations, forks, or feedback on all of our projects."
