      "This talk mainly focuses on showcasing the work that some PSE members did while starting to dive into MPC-FHE during Q2 2024. This work is composed by various explorations within the MPC-FHE realm that move towards different directions and goals. From FHE compilers to FFT Bootstrapping GPU optimization proposals, passing by FHE Game demos and many application level implementations, the talk aims to reach beginner-advanced audience on the research/product paths that we have explored so far.",

    title: "Modern ZKP Compilers",
    description:
      "At PSE we have done much ZKP advanced development. From that learning we are building a language and compiler, that is summarizing much of this learning. We answer questions like: Are compilers necessary in a zkVM world? What is the role of a compiler in ZKP development? What are its most common components? How different ways can this problem be approached? In this advanced talk, we will learn how we compile arbitrary boolean expressions, or how the Schwartzâ€“Zippel lemma can be used to optimize.",

    description:
      "A short talk introducing the concepts of key principles we want to achieve in private ZK identities. Sparkling concepts like SSI and DIDs and why blockchains are the best way to ensure that. Finally it concludes with simple ZK and data-structure constructions and different alternatives that are seeking to provide this characteristics. In short, this is a lightning overview of the space of ZK, its desired features and different approaches to achieve them.",
